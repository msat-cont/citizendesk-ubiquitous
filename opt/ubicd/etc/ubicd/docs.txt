Ubiquitous part of the Citizen Desk
___________________________________

Current web serving parts of the UbiCD system are prepared
just for early developmemt purposes.

It is necessary to configure a web server (e.g. Nginx) to work
as a reverse proxy for the two -- static and dynamic -- web
servers of the UbiCD system.

The dynamic part itself uses MondoDB, Flask python framework
and accompanying libraries.
